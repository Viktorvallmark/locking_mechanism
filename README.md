# locking_mechanism

Tinkering about with a mcu controlled locking mechanism. Using a SoC based on nRF52833 to regulate when a door lock should be open or closed. This particular SoC is a BBC Microbit:v2 which has radio functionality and a microphone which can possibly be part of how you control the locking mechanism, haven't decided yet. 


This project will be written in Zig which means the documentation won't all be there and will force me to explore and experiment. I'm using Zig because of the interoperability with C and I'm just really enjoying the language.
